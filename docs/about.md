Hi, I'm Sam Patterson, a machine learning research engineer based in Squamish, BC, Canada.

Currently I work for RBC Borealis. Before that I worked for G-Research and KCG in London.

Before that, I dropped out of a machine learning Ph.D. at the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/) at UCL, but did manage to publish one [NeurIPS paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2013/hash/309928d4b100a5d75adff48a9bfc1ddb-Abstract.html) before doing so.

You can contact me at sam.x.patterson at google's email service.
